Web app that helps you with inspecting vehicles according to TSFS 2017:54

## Current problem & Purpose (In progress)

Currently it is quite hard to find resources concerning vehicle inspections that are easy to use. My aim is to present the information regarding vehicle inspections in a simple way but also create a tool that can be used to inspect a vehicle according to the standard.

The information should be easy to find and understand (Information = Bilaga 1, TSFS 2017:54). Assisting the user to find the desired information there should be a easy navigation and a live search function, maybe even a auto-complete search.

For the tooling, there should be two tiers to it. The first tier should satisfy the requirements of a basic user while the second tier should satisfy the requirements of an advanced user.

### What does the tools help with?

The tool should be used to assist the inspection of a vehicle through step-by-step guide. The amount of details should be tailored to the tiers previously mentioned. For the advanced user there should be a way to note down the observations during the inspection according to the standards specified by TSFS 2017:54
